<<<<<<< HEAD
npm - global command, comes with Node
npm --version

local dependency - use it only in this particular project
npm i <packageName>

global dependency - use it in any project
npm install -g <packageName>

package.json - manifest file (store imp info about project/package)
manual approach (create package.json in the root, create properties etc)

npm init (step by step, press enter to skip)
npm init -y (everything default)



if we copy the repo or see other's project so we can use npm install to install the dependencies

if we use to install devdependencies so we can use -D --save-dev

 for uninstalling the package use npm uninstall <packageName>
